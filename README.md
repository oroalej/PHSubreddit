| [r/balintawak](https://www.reddit.com/r/balintawak/)                 | Balintawak esprima is a Filipino martial art that teaches compact, powerful movements, often using fighting sticks, but the style translates to any weapon or non-weapon combat, including boxing and kickboxing. While Balintawak traditionally uses one stick, there are other eskrima styles that use two sticks. But the results are the same: strong defense, tactical approach, and devastating strikes. |
